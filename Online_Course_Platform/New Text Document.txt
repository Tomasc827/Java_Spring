Exercise: Online Course Platform
You will build a simplified Online Course Platform using Spring Boot with a database that manages courses, instructors, students, and course enrollments.

Entities:
Instructor (One-to-Many with Course)

An instructor can teach multiple courses.
Each instructor has personal details (name, email, etc.)
Course (Many-to-One with Instructor, Many-to-Many with Students)

A course has a single instructor but may have many students.
Each course will have a title, description, and duration.
Student (Many-to-Many with Courses)

A student can enroll in many courses.
Each student has a name, email, and date of birth.
Course Enrollment (Many-to-One with Course, Many-to-One with Student)

This entity will track the relationship between students and courses, including enrollment date and completion status.
